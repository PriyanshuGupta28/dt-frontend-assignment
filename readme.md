Hey, sir.
I encountered numerous errors, such as cors, while obtaining the data using Axios (useReducer and useState), which prevented me from mapping the data and displaying it on the user interface. I had to hard code everything because of this.
I gave this job my best effort, and I made it fully responsive to all devices.

I apologise for not being able to follow all instructions.
Thanks to this task, I learned a lot.
